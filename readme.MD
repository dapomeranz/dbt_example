## Using dbt on Manufacturing Data

Repository of code used for my YouTube video on using dbt to transform manufacturing data.

From dbt - "dbt is a data transformation tool that allows you to transform data in your warehouse. It is a great tool for data engineers and data analysts alike. It allows you to transform data in your warehouse using SQL and Jinja. It also allows you to test your data transformations and document your data models."

My thoughts - dbt and the patterns it offers are a great way to understand what data maturity should look like. The ability to store version controlled, nested layers of data transformation along with documentation and testing in one place is the future of working with data, and while not every business is set up to go this far, the concepts are important to understand. As the world moves towards more data driven decision making, the ability to trust the data you are using is paramount. dbt is a great tool to help you get there.
